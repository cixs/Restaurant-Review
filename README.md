# Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, it was given a static design that lacks accessibility and it was required to incrementally convert this static  webpage to a mobile-ready web application, responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Another requirement was to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### Specification

The initial code has a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It didn't include any standard accessibility features, and also it didn't  work offline at all. The project requirement was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. 

### About setup

In order to run properly and serve up the site files on your local computer, this website should run on a web server. Working for this project, I was using the simple local http-server (for Node), but there are many other options.
